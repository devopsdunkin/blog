My name's Chris and I am an infrastructure engineer with 10+ years working in IT in various industries. I recently started a new job back in February 2019 that got me involved with a lot of new tools. As I have been learning more about them and this whole DevOps methodology, I have stumbled across many things that aren't well documented in the wild. So I started this blog to help fill that gap.

If you're interested in connecting or learning more about me, feel free to reach out!
